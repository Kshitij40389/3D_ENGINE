# 3D_ENGINE
Description:
This GitHub repository contains a Python program that demonstrates 3D rendering of an OBJ file with rotation around the Y-axis. It uses Pygame for the graphical interface and includes classes for camera control, projection, and 3D object rendering.

Key Features:
3D rendering of OBJ files.
Y-axis rotation of the 3D object.
Camera control for navigation.
Simple and educational example of 3D graphics in Python.

How to Use:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (Pygame).
Run the SoftwareRender.py script.
Example OBJ File:
The program is set up to load and render a sample OBJ file (t_34_obj.obj) included in the resources directory. You can replace it with your own OBJ files for different 3D objects.
